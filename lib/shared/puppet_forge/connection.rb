module PuppetForge
  # Provide a common mixin for adding a HTTP connection to classes.
  #
  # This module provides a common method for creating HTTP connections as well
  # as reusing a single connection object between multiple classes. Including
  # classes can invoke #conn to get a reasonably configured HTTP connection.
  # Connection objects can be passed with the #conn= method.
  #
  # @example
  #   class HTTPThing
  #     include PuppetForge::Connection
  #   end
  #   thing = HTTPThing.new
  #   thing.conn = thing.make_connection('https://non-standard-forge.site')
